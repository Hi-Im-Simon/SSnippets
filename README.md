## Quickstart
To enable SSnippets simply copy files with types of snippets that you need to the `.vscode` directory of your project.

## Account-sync
To sync SSnippets across multiple devices using the same account you first need to have your VSCode settings sync turned _on_.

Then:
* Press `ctrl+shift+p`.
* Look for an option `Snippets: Configure snippets` and select it.
* Select a file type that you want to use the snippets for (eg. _typescriptreact_ to enable snippets only in _.tsx_ files).
* Paste selected SSnippets to the JSON file.
